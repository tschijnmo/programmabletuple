    The actual initializer will be invoked with objects of this proxy class
    as ``self``. Then after the user-defined initialization, the values for
    the various fields are read from this proxy object and set into the
    actual programmable tuple. In this meta-class, the core functionality of
    defining the proxy class and wrapping the user-defined init function is
